#  Practical3 

 This folder contain practical 3 codes
* In this practical we learn how to print the integer,floats,double 
* How to to use different kind of the loops, for,while and conditions statements if,switch
* There two programs with file name program1.f90 which is for printning variable like integer and floats usning Fortran
* Second program name is trap.f90 which is about program for calculating area under the curve using trapizodal rule
#  outpot of the program1 

* when you run the program1.f90 it will generate two integer 10,200 and two floats 1.11 ,2.2222
#  Output of the trap.f90

* Output of the trap.f90 just shows the results by trapezoidal rule which is 0.695044975

* log(2) results is 0.69315047 

* This code is working well as there is no big different between both

* You can check this by running with different kind of loops and conditions statements 

*     Thanks for reading 

*     Cheers 
