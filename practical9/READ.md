# Practical9 

 This folder contain codes of the practical9 that we performed in live session today

## Compile:
*  There is main file with name "main.f90" so to compile this use this with gfortran main.f90 -o ss2
*  There are some others supportive files in the folder that is magic_square.fh 
*  magic_square.text not_magic_square.text that will be used after compiling 

## Execute:
*  ./ss2 
* After enter the file name with format like "magic_square.txt"
* This code is working fine as i learned through the live session
