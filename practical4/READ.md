# Practical04

This folder contains practical4 codes that we have done in live session for area calculation using traprule function
## Compile :
*  gfortran newtrap80.f90 -o trap
## Execute :

* ./trap

*  This code is compling but giving error means result is not same as we got in live session,but the code is same.
*  I typed after taking screenshot,i cannot figureout the error as it is same code that we did.
*  I also matched line by line but it is still giving error
